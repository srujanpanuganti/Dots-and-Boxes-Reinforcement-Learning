## Project - Dots and Boxes using Reinforcement learning
This project is an implementation of Dots and Boxes game using Reinforcement Learning - Q Learning Approach
The project is implemented for 2X2 grid configuration and 3X3 grid configuration
The Project can generate trained Q-table for games played between random agents
This project can be used to view the results of Q-Agent played against a Random agent

## Executing the project 
Scripts in `Src2` folder has the implementation of the game for 2X2 grid. Train the network by executing

`python3 test.py`

Scripts in `Src3` folder has the implementation of the game for 3x3 grid. Train the network by executing 

`python3 test.py`

The project is being implemented using Q- Learning with functional approximation. This part is not completed

`python3 neural_network.py`

## Results
This project doesn't generate any visual results at this point of time. 

The `2x2 Random Agent` folder has the implementation of the game for 2x2 grid with a random agent. Use the following command to see the results

`python3 test.py`

The 3x3 Random Agent folder has the implementation of the game for 3x3 grid with a random agent. Use the following command to see the results

`python3 test.py`

All the results are included and updated in the report_1.pdf
